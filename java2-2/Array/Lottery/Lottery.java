/*
	Write a Lottery class that simulates a lottery.
	The class should have an array of five integers named lotteryNumbers.
	The class should have:
	*A constructor that uses the Random class to generate a random number
		in the range of 0 though 9 for each element in the array.
	*A method that accepts an array of five integers that represent a personâ€™s lottery picks.
		This method is to compare the corresponding elements in the two arrays
		and return the number of digits that match.
	*A method return a copy of the lotteryNumbers array.
	*
	Demonstrate the class in the program that asks the user to enter five numbers.
	The program should display the number of digits that match the randomly generated lottery numbers.
	If all of the digits match, display a message proclaiming the user a grand prize winner.
